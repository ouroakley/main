The Our Oakley Content Management System (CMS) uses [GitHub](https://github.com) login to manage content on the website. You will not use GitHub directly, but you will need a GitHub account to sign in to the CMS and manage your community event listings. This allows organisers to securely add, edit, and remove events through the website.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

1. Visit [GitHub's signup page](https://github.com/signup)
2. Enter your email address
3. Create a strong password
4. Choose a username (this will be your GitHub handle)
5. Verify your email address

Remember: Your GitHub account will be used to log in to Our Oakley CMS and manage your community events, so please keep your login credentials secure and do not share credentials.

## Step 2: Contact Us

After creating and verifying your GitHub account, please contact us with the following information:
